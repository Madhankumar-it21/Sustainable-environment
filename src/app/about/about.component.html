        <p class="text">India's difficulty is its unclean society, particularly its water, sanitation, and
          drainage infrastructure. Within four to five days, the appropriate worker may
          arrive to clean that location. Until then, these wastes may spread several
          diseases through the air and animals, as well as degrade the environment.
          When the appropriate person doesn't show up, the society becomes
          increasingly unclean. India generates between 0.2 and 0.6 pounds of trash per
          person every day.</p>

          will be forwarded to a higher authority. After some time has passed since the

          complaint session is the primary component. When we click the complaint
          session link, a login prompt appears. After providing the necessary
          geolocation information and user details, we must select the relevant
          department (water, sanitation, garbage, and drainage management), after
          which we must upload a photo or a video of that department. The appropriate could be safe.</p>
